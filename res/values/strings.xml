        Use to share your location how you want, whether it\'s SMS,
        Email, Twitter, or something else. Because this app uses no external
        services besides Google Maps, your privacy isn\'t a concern. 
        This app is an Open Source application and has no advertising. Internet
        access is used only to download Google Maps tiles.&lt;br/&gt;
