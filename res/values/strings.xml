        Use GPS Share to share your location how you want, whether it\'s SMS,
        Email, Twitter, or something else. Because GPS Share uses no external
        services besides Google Maps, your privacy isn\'t a concern. GPS
        Share is an Open Source application and has no advertising. Internet
        access is used only to download Google Maps tiles.&lt;br/&gt;
